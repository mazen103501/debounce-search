 ## Note: 
 **the app is deployed with github pages the Link for it [here](https://mazen103501.github.io/debounce-search/)**

 ## Note: 
 **GitHub Pages does not support browser history like your browser does. In our case, the route https://mazen103501.github.io/debounce-search/favorites doesn't help GitHub Pages understand where to point the user since it is a frontend route, To overcome this problem, we need to use a Hash Router instead of a Browser Router in our application. This type of router uses the hash portion of the URL to keep the UI in sync with the URL.**
